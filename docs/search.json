    "text": "Hi, my name is Wenqing, though you can also call me Cathy—it sounds like “happy” (开心) in Mandarin. I was born in Xi’an, China, and have lived in several places around the world, including Singapore, Maine, and now Maryland, where I’m pursuing a Master’s in Biostatistics.\nMy academic journey has been diverse, weaving together life sciences, social sciences, and quantitative analysis. During my undergraduate studies, I gained hands-on experience with environmental data as well as clinical trial management and clinical data analysis, which eventually sparks my current interest in advancing statistical methods to better interpret trial data.\nOutside of academics, my experiences living in different countries and regions have also inspired me to make sustainable choices that support a healthier planet. I enjoy volunteering at day camps to teach K-12 students about environmental awareness and am committed to continually learning ways to preserve and embrace the beauty of nature.\n\nEducation\n\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\nBaltimore, MD\nScM in Biostatistics\nAugust 2024 - May 2026\nJohns Hopkins University\nBaltimore, MD\nB.S. in Public Health Studies and Environmental Science\nAugust 2020 - May 2024"

Bill Length and Depth: Gentoo penguins have longer, shallower bills, Adelie penguins have shorter, deeper bills, and Chinstrap penguins show intermediate characteristics. Other Morphological Traits: Box plots highlighted that Gentoo penguins have the longest flippers, heaviest body mass, and shallowest bill depth; Adelie penguins in most cases share similar traits with Chinstrap penguins, with only one exception that Adelie has a significnat shorter bill length than Chinstrap penguins. These findings contribute to our understanding of penguin morphology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcological Significance\n\n\n\nThese morphological differences likely reflect adaptations to distinct ecological niches among Gentoo, Adelie, and Chinstrap penguins. Gentoo penguins’ greater body mass and longer flippers may enhance their foraging efficiency, especially on Biscoe Island. Variations in bill characteristics suggest dietary specialization, with each species potentially adapted to different prey or feeding techniques. Such physical distinctions emphasize the role of evolutionary adaptations in reducing interspecies competition and highlight potential resilience or vulnerability to environmental changes, offering valuable insights for conservation efforts in the Antarctic ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr: drop_na(), mutate(), group_by(), summarise()\ntidyr: pivot_longer()\nggplot2: ggplot(), aes(), geom_col(), geom_point(), geom_smooth(), geom_text(), geom_boxplot(), facet_wrap(), scale_fill_viridis_d(), scale_color_viridis_d(), labs(),theme_minimal(), theme()"
