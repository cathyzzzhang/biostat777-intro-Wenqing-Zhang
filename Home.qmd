As a first-year ScM student in Biostatistics, I’m driven by a passion for using statistical analysis to make tangible improvements in public health, ultimately generating meaningful evidence that informs healthcare decisions, enhances well-being, and fosters happiness. Outside of academics, I find peace and inspiration in nature—whether I'm sitting on the rocks at Stony Run, exploring new trails, or enjoying a good hike.
