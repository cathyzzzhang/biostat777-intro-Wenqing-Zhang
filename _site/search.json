    "text": "Hi, I’m Cathy! My name sounds like “happy” (开心) in Mandarin, and I like to think it suits me well. I was born in Xi’an, China, and have had the chance to live in several places around the world, including Singapore, Maine, and now Maryland, where I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Biostatistics.\nMy academic path weaves together life sciences, social sciences, and quantitative analysis, and I’m especially passionate about research areas like clinical trials, survival analysis, spatial statistics (I love map-making!), and causal inference. I enjoy applying analytical methods to tackle complex public health questions and uncover meaningful insights from data.\nOutside of my studies, I’m dedicated to being a globally conscious and environmentally responsible citizen. My experiences living in different countries have shaped my worldview and inspired me to make choices that support sustainability and contribute to a healthier planet. This perspective drives me to make positive changes both locally and globally.\n\nEducation\n\nJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\nBaltimore, MD\nScM in Biostatistics\nAugust 2024 - May 2026\nJohns Hopkins University\nBaltimore, MD\nB.S. in Public Health and Environmental Science\nAugust 2020 - May 2024"
