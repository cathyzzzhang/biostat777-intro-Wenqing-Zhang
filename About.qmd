Hi, my name is Wenqing, though you can also call me Cathy—it sounds like “happy” (开心) in Mandarin. I was born in Xi’an, China, and have lived in several places around the world, including Singapore, Maine, and now Maryland, where I’m pursuing a Master’s in Biostatistics.

My academic journey has been diverse, weaving together life sciences, social sciences, and quantitative analysis. During my undergraduate studies, I gained hands-on experience with environmental data as well as clinical trial management and clinical data analysis, which eventually sparks my current interest in advancing statistical methods to better interpret trial data.

Outside of academics, my experiences living in different countries and regions have also inspired me to make sustainable choices that support a healthier planet. I enjoy volunteering at day camps to teach K-12 students about environmental awareness and am committed to continually learning ways to preserve and embrace the beauty of nature.
